                      Harry James[56] Potter (b. 31 July 1980)[1] was an English
                      half-blood[2] wizard, and one of the most famous wizards
                      of modern times. The only child and son of James and Lily
                      Potter (n√©e Evans), Harry's birth was overshadowed by a
                      prophecy, naming either himself or Neville Longbottom as
                      the one with the power to vanquish Lord Voldemort, the
                      most powerful and feared Dark wizard in the world. After
                      half of the prophecy was reported to Voldemort, courtesy
                      of Severus Snape, Harry was chosen as the target due to
                      his many similarities with the Dark Lord. This in turn
                      caused the Potter family to go into hiding.

                      Harry was also noted for being the only known Master of
                      Death, having united the three Deathly Hallows at the mere
                      age of seventeen.

                      married Ginny, with whom he had three children: James
                      Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna. He was also named
                      the godfather of Edward "Teddy" Remus Lupin.
