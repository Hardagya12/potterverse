              Professor Severus Snape (9 January 1960[1] – 2 May 1998)[2] was an
              English half-blood[3] wizard serving as Potions Master
              (1981-1996), Head of Slytherin House (1981-1997), Defence Against
              the Dark Arts professor (1996-1997), and Headmaster (1997-1998) of
              the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as well as a member
              of the Order of the Phoenix and a Death Eater. His double life
              played an extremely important role in both of the Wizarding Wars
              against Voldemort.
            </p>
            <p className="p"> </p>
            <p className="the-only-child">
              The only child of Muggle Tobias Snape and witch Eileen Snape (née
              Prince), Severus was raised in the Muggle dwelling of Spinner's
              End, which was in close proximity to the home of the Evans family,
              though in a poorer area. He met Lily and Petunia Evans when he was
              nine. He fell deeply in love with Lily upon their meeting and
              became a close friend of hers.[7]
            </p>
            <p className="p1"> </p>
            <p className="severus-started-at">
              Severus started at Hogwarts with Lily in 1971, where he was sorted
              into Slytherin House. This put him in the same year as Lily but
              unfortunately for him she was sorted into Gryffindor House.
              Severus became the immediate enemy of James Potter and Sirius
              Black and was a frequent victim of their bullying. This led him to
              be irritable towards James's son Harry when he was a professor.
              Snape, when young, developed a passion for the Dark Arts, which
              increased as his desire for revenge against his bullies grew
              stronger.
            </p>
            <p className="p2"> </p>
            <p className="snape-became-involved">
              Snape became involved with the bullies in Slytherin House, many of
              whom were pure-blood supremacists. This put his friendship with
              Lily, a Muggle-born, under great strain until it was eventually
              broken in their fifth year.[6][7] In a misguided attempt to win
              back Lily's affections,[18] Snape joined the Death Eaters along
              with a group of his fellow Slytherins.
            </p>
            <p className="p3"> </p>
            <p className="severus-was-made">
              Severus was made a member of the Slug Club presumably because of
              his talent in Potion-making. Horace Slughorn even kept a picture
              of him as a student, clutching his copy of Advanced Potion-Making.
              However, Horace did not actually have many hopes for Severus's
              future, as his photograph was kept behind many others.[19]
            </p>
            <p className="p4"> </p>
            <p className="as-an-active">
              As an active Death Eater, one of Snape's biggest contributions was
              letting Lord Voldemort know about the prophecy Sybill Trelawney
              made to Dumbledore. This part of the prophecy could have applied
              to either Harry Potter or Neville Longbottom, who was also born at
              the end of July 1980 to parents who were members of the Order.
              Once Lord Voldemort decided to target the Potters over the
              Longbottoms, Snape begged Voldemort to at least spare Lily.
              Voldemort agreed, then did not follow through on this promise.
            </p>
            <p className="p5"> </p>
            <p className="shortly-before-lily">
              Shortly before Lily Evans was murdered by Lord Voldemort, Snape
              changed sides and became a member of the Order of the Phoenix as
              well as a double agent during the Second Wizarding War. With
              tremendous difficulty, Snape prevented Lord Voldemort from
              learning the truth about his loyalties.
            </p>
            <p className="p6"> </p>
            <p className="despite-the-opinions">
              Despite the opinions of most others including Harry during his
              early life, Albus Dumbledore trusted Snape for reasons that were
              kept between them both until their deaths. Despite Snape killing
              Dumbledore, it is learned that they had a special agreement for
              him to do so. When he died, it was revealed that his deep strong
              love for Lily Evans caused him to redeem himself, joining
              Dumbledore's cause for her protection (and, after her death, that
              of her son) from Lord Voldemort.[7]
            </p>
            <p className="p7"> </p>
            <p className="the-relationship-between">
              The relationship between Dumbledore and Snape would be one of
              unusually strong loyalty, so much so that Snape agreed to kill
              Dumbledore upon the latter's own request. Before Dumbledore's
              death, Snape promised to protect the students of Hogwarts from the
              Death Eaters, who would inevitably take control of the Ministry of
              Magic as well as the school.[7]
            </p>
            <p className="p8"> </p>
            <p className="snape-later-participated">
              Snape later participated in the Battle of Hogwarts but was
              murdered by Lord Voldemort who mistakenly believed that Snape was
              the master of the Elder Wand (an immensely strong and powerful
              wand that Voldemort deeply desired, as well as one of the Deathly
              Hallows)[20] when in reality, Harry Potter was the master of the
              Elder Wand, because Draco Malfoy had disarmed Dumbledore on the
              night of Dumbledore's death on top of the Astronomy Tower, and
              Harry had disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor.[21]
            </p>
            <p className="p9"> </p>
            <p className="after-snapes-death">
              After Snape's death, Harry Potter ensured that his portrait
              remained at Hogwarts, honouring him as a hero, despite their
              significant personal differences.[21] In addition, Harry later
              named his second son Albus Severus Potter in honour of Dumbledore
              and Severus, both of whom were an inspiration in Harry's life
              after the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry also was influenced by
              Severus' Hogwarts house, and freely admitted that his son Albus
              could choose Slytherin if he wished
